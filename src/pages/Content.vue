                    <p>
                        Graph structure emerges in many important domain applications, including but not limited to
                        computer vision, natural sciences, social networks, languages and knowledge graphs. This course
                        offers an introduction to
                        deep learning algorithms applied to such graph-structured data. The first part of the course is
                        an introduction to
                        representation
                        learning for graphs, and covers common techniques in the field, including distributed node
                        embeddings, graph neural
                        networks, deep graph generative models and non-Euclidean embeddings. The first part also touches
                        upon topics of
                        real-world significance, including auto-ML and explainability for graph learning. The second
                        part of the course covers important applications of graph machine learning. We learn ways to
                        model data as graphs and apply graph learning techniques to problems in domains including online
                        recommender systems, knowledge graphs, biological networks, physical simulations and graph
                        mining. The course covers many deep techniques (graph neural networks, graph deep generative
                        models) catered to graph structures. We will cover basic deep learning tutorials in this course.

                <h1>Prerequisites</h1>
                CPSC 201, CPSC 223, and one of CPSC 365 or CPSC 366. Knowledge of graphs as a data structure, and
                understanding
                of
                basic graph algorithms are essential for applying machine learning to graph-structured data. Familiarity
                with
                Python
                and important libraries such as Numpy and Pandas are helpful. CPSC 452 and CPSC 453 are highly
                recommended
                prior
                because they cover the foundations of deep neural networks. Experience in machine Learning courses such
                as
                CPSC
                481,
                and Graph Theory courses such as CPSC 462 are welcomed as well.
